% Introduction
%
This section describes how the line of sight (LOS) is determined
for situations where the atmosphere is assumed to be horizontally
stratified, a 1D atmosphere. Expressions are given both for pure
geometrical calculations and when considering refraction.



\levelb{Definitions}
 \label{sec:los:defs}
 
 Vertical (geometrical) altitudes are denoted as $z$, pressures as $p$
 and distances along the LOS are denoted as $l$. Vertical distances
 are measured from the geoid and $l$ is the distance from the lowest
 point of the LOS. 
 
 As a 1D atmosphere is assumed here, the conditions are symmetrical
 around tangent points and points of ground reflection, and, for such
 cases, only one half of the LOS is stored for efficiency reasons.
 The points of the LOS are stored by increasing vertical altitude
 point. Index 1 corresponds accordingly to either the platform, the
 tangent point or the ground.  The internal description of the LOS is
 further described in the file \verb|los.h|.
  
 The line of sight is defined by two variables, the platform altitude,
 $z_p$, and the zenith angle, $\view$, (see Fig. \ref{fig:los1d:geoms}):

 \begin{description}
  \item[The platform altitude] is the altitude above the geoid of the
       sensor used to detect the spectrum simulated.
  \item[The zenith angle] is the angle between the zenith
       direction and the direction of observation. As an 1D atmosphere is
       assumed, there is no difference between positive and negative
       zenith angles.
  \end{description}

  \noindent
  The lower limit of the atmosphere is given by the ground altitude,
  $z_g$. The practical upper limit of the atmosphere is denoted
  $z_{lim}$ and is in the forward model determined by the highest
  point of the absorption grid. The absorption grid can
  extend below $z_g$. On the other hand, it is not allowed that any
  part of the LOS is between the lowest absorption altitude and the ground.
 
  If $\view>90^{\circ}$ the lowest point of the LOS is not the platform
  altitude, and this point is denoted as the tangent point, $z_t$. The
  angle between the LOS and the vector to the Earth center is at the
  tangent point $90^\circ$. If the tangent point is below ground
  level, $z_t$ is determined by an imaginary geometric prolonging of
  the LOS inside the Earth.

  \begin{figure}[tb]
   \begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=0.95\hsize]{Figs/geoms}
    \caption{Schematic description of the main variables of the 
             observation geometry and the LOS. $R_e$ is the Earth
             radius. Other variables are defined in the text.}  
    \label{fig:los1d:geoms}  
   \end{center}
  \end{figure}
  
  The forward model uses internally three main observation geometries:

  \begin{description}
  \item[Limb sounding] covers here all observations from a point
    outside the atmosphere ($z_p \geq z_{lim}$). All zenith angles are
    covered, and, for example, nadir looking observations
    ($\view=180$) are treated as limb sounding in the forward model.
    If the LOS does not pass the atmosphere ($z_{tan} \geq z_{lim}$),
    cosmic background radiation, or correspondingly, is returned.
  \item[Upward looking] signifies observation from
    within the atmosphere in an upward direction ($z_p<z_{lim}$ and
    $\view\leq90^{\circ}$). 
  \item[Downward looking] is observation from within the atmosphere in
    a downward direction ($z_p<z_{lim}$ and $\view>90^{\circ}$).
  \end{description}
 

\levelb{Outlook towards 2D}
 \label{sec:los:2d}
 So far ARTS is only capable of calculating spectra for 1D cases.
 It is planned to also handle satellite measurements with atmospheric 
 horizontal variations, but limited to observations in the orbit
 plane, here denoted as 2D observations. 
 
 For 2D observations there is no symmetry to be used, each point of
 the LOS is unique. This is also the case for 1D upward looking
 observations, and it is planned that 2D and 1D upward calculations of
 radiative transfer and weighting functions shall be performed with
 the same general functions.  The 2D case exhibits however one
 difference compared to the 1D upward case. For 2D cases there could
 be a ground reflection along the LOS, which is never the case for 1D
 upward looking observations by definition.  Note that if the 1D
 upward functions are used for 2D simulations, the point of LOS
 closest to the sensor will throughout have index 1.

 As a first preparation for the 2D calculations, the angular distances
 between the sensor and the points of the LOS, $\psi$, are stored
 beside the pressure and vertical altitudes of the points. The
 variable $\psi$ is defined to be the angle between the vectors going
 from the Earth's center to the sensor and the LOS point,
 respectively.  For cases with symmetry, the angles are valid for the
 part of the LOS furthest away from the sensor.
 


\levelb{The step length}
 \label{sec:rte:stepl}
 
 As described in Section \ref{sec:rte}, the LOS is divided into equal
 long geometrical steps, $\Delta l$. The user gives an upper limit for
 this step length. A point of the LOS is always placed at the sensor
 (if inside the atmosphere), tangent points and points of ground
 reflection, but no adjustment to the upper atmospheric limit is made.
 This gives a single fixed point for limb sounding and upward looking
 observation and $\Delta l$ is set to the value given by the user if
 the LOS has at least two definition points. If the LOS gets only one
 point with the user defined value, for example when the tangent point
 is just below the atmospheric limit, the step length is adjusted to
 the length from the fixed point of the LOS (the sensor or the tangent 
 point) and the atmospheric limit.
 
 In contrast to upward and limb sounding observations, for downward
 observations there are two fixed points inside the atmosphere (the
 platform and the tangent point, or the point of ground reflection)
 and $\Delta l$ is here adjusted according to the the distance between
 these two points. See further Section \ref{sec:los:down}.



\levelb{Geometrical calculations}
 
 \levelc{General expressions}
  \label{sec:los:general}

  The relationship between vertical altitude ($z$) and distance along
  LOS ($l$) can be found be the law of cosines, giving
  \begin{equation}
    (R_e+z)^2 = (R_e+z_0)^2 + l^2 + 2l(R_e+z_0)\cos(\view)
  \end{equation}
  where $z_0$ is the lowest point of the LOS (where $l=0$) and \view\
  is the angle between the LOS and zenith at $z_0$. This equation 
  gives
  \begin{equation}
    z = \sqrt{ (R_e+z_0)^2 + l^2 + 2l(R_e+z_0)\cos(\view) } - R_e
   \label{eq:los:geom:z}
  \end{equation}
  The distance between the sensor and the limit of the atmosphere is
  \begin{equation}
      l_{lim} = \sqrt{ (R_e+z_{lim})^2 - (R_e+z_0)^2\sin^2(\view) } - 
                                       (R_e+z_0)\cos(\view)
   \label{eq:los:geom:llim}
  \end{equation}
  The angle $\psi$ between the point corresponding to $z_0$ and
  some altitude $z$ is
  \begin{equation}
      \psi = \cos^{-1}\left( \frac{(R_e+z_0)^2 + (R_e+z)^2 - l^2}
                                                   {2(R_e+z_0)(R_e+z)} \right) 
   \label{eq:los:geom:psi}
  \end{equation} 



 \levelc{Limb sounding}
  \label{sec:los:limb}
  
  For limb sounding the lowest point of the LOS is (by definition) the
  tangent point, and it is given by the expression
  \begin{equation}
    z_t = (R_e+z_p)\sin(\view) - R_e \qquad  \view\geq90^\circ
   \label{eq:los:ztan}
  \end{equation}
  This relationship holds even if $z_t<z_g$. Note that
  $\sin(180^\circ-\view)=\sin(\view)$ and it must be checked that
  $\view\geq90^\circ$. Zenith angles $<90^\circ$ correspond to an
  imaginary tangent point behind the sensor, and are treated as
  observations into the space.

  The LOS starting at the tangent point is then calculated by 
  Equations \ref{eq:los:geom:z} -- \ref{eq:los:geom:psi} with $z_0 = z_t$
  and $\view = 90^\circ$. The angle between the vectors going from the
  Earth's center and the sensor and the tangent point, respectively,
  is
  \begin{equation}
    \psi_0 = \view - 90^\circ
  \end{equation}
  The value of $\psi_0$ is added to the angles given by Equation 
  \ref{eq:los:geom:psi} as the equation in this case gives the angles 
  from the tangent point instead from the sensor.

  If the tangent point is below ground, $z_0$ is set to $z_g$ and \view\
  to $\view_g$ where
  \begin{equation}
    \view_g = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{R_e+z_t}{R_e+z_g} \right)
  \end{equation}
  The correction term for $\psi$ is here
  \begin{equation}
    \psi_0 =  \view + \view_g - 180^\circ
  \end{equation}



 \levelc{Upward looking}   
  \label{sec:los:up}

  The LOS for upward looking observations is given by Equations 
  \ref{eq:los:geom:z} -- \ref{eq:los:geom:psi} where $z_0$ is set to
  the platform altitude and \view\ to the observation zenith angle.



 \levelc{Downward looking}
  \label{sec:los:down}

  The altitude of the tangent point is given by Equation \ref
  {eq:los:ztan}. As both the sensor and the tangent point (or the
  ground) are treated to be fixed points of the LOS, the step length
  must be adjusted. The distance between the sensor and a tangent point is
  \begin{equation}
    l_p = \sqrt{ (R_e+z_p)^2 - (R_e+z_t)^2 } \qquad  z_t \geq z_g
  \end{equation}
  and the distance between the sensor and a point of ground
  reflection is
  \begin{equation}
    l_p = \sqrt{ (R_e+z_p)^2 - (R_e+z_t)^2 } - \sqrt{ (R_e+z_g)^2-(R_e+z_t)^2}
            \qquad z_t < z_g
  \end{equation}
  The part of the LOS between the sensor and the tangent or ground
  point gets the following number of points:
  \begin{equation}
     m = 1 + \mathbf{ ceil}(l_{lim}/\Delta l_{max})
   \label{eq:los:m}
  \end{equation}
  where $\Delta l_{max}$ is the upper limit for $\Delta l$ specified by
  the user, and $\mathbf{ ceil}$ is a function giving the first integer
  larger than the argument. The step length is accordingly
  \begin{equation}
     \Delta l = \frac{l_{lim}}{m-1}
   \label{eq:los:dl}
  \end{equation} 
  The LOS is determined in the same manner as for limb sounding
  described above, but with the adjusted value for $\Delta l$.
  The angular distance between the the tangent point, or the ground.
  and the sensor $(\psi_0)$ is value $m$ of the angle vector given by 
  Equation \ref{eq:los:geom:psi}.

  

 \levelb{With refraction}
  \label{sec:los:refraction}
  
  Refraction affects the radiative transfer in several ways. The
  distance through a layer of a fixed vertical thickness will be
  changed, and for a limb sounding observation the tangent point is
  moved both vertically and horizontally. If the atmosphere is assumed
  to be horizontally stratified, as done here (1D), a horizontal
  displacement is of no importance but for 2D calculations this effect
  must be considered. For limb sounding and a fixed zenith angle, the
  tangent point is moved downwards compared to the pure geometrical
  case, resulting in that inclusion of refraction in general gives
  higher intensities. However, the LOS is still symmetric around
  tangent and ground points.

 \levelc{General theory}
  \label{sec:los:reftheory}

   When determining the LOS through the atmosphere geometrical optics 
   can be applied because the change of the refractive index over a
   wavelength can be neglected. Applying Snell's law to the geometry 
   shown in Figure \ref{fig:los:snell} gives
   \begin{equation}
     n_i \sin (\theta_i) = n_{i+1} \sin (\theta_i')
   \end{equation}
   \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics*{Figs/snell}
      \caption{Geometry to derive Snell's law for a spherical atmosphere. 
               The Earth radius is $R_e$, the vertical
               altitude $z$, the refractive index $n$ and the angle
               between the LOS and the vector to the Earth center $\theta$.}
      \label{fig:los:snell} 
    \end{center} 
  \end{figure}
  Using the same figure, the law of sines gives the relationship
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\sin(\theta_{i+1})}{R_e+z_i} = 
    \frac{\sin(180^\circ-\theta_{i+1}')}{R_e+z_{i+1}} =
    \frac{\sin(\theta_i')}{R_e+z_{i+1}} 
  \end{equation}
  By combining the two equations above, the Snell's law for a spherical
  atmosphere (i.e. 1D) is derived \citep[e.g.][]{kyle:91,balluch:97}:
  \begin{equation}
    c = (R_e+z_i) n_i \sin(\theta_i) = (R_e+z_{i+1}) n_{i+1}\sin(\theta_{i+1}) 
   \label{eq:los:snellspherical}
  \end{equation}
  where $c$ is a constant. With other words, the Snell's law for spherical
  atmospheres states that the product of $n$, $(R_e+z)$ and $\sin(\theta)$ is
  constant along the LOS.

  The radiative transfer is evaluated along the LOS, while Equation 
  \ref{eq:los:snellspherical} is expressed for vertical altitudes.
  The relationship between a change in vertical altitude and the
  corresponding change along the LOS is here denoted as the geometrical term
  and it is
  \begin{equation}
    g(z) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}
  \end{equation}
  which can be rewritten using trigonometric identities and Equation
  \ref{eq:los:snellspherical}:
  \begin{equation}
    g(z) = \frac {(R_e+z)n(z)} {\sqrt{ (R_e+z)^2n^2(z) - c^2 }}
   \label{eq:los:gterm}
  \end{equation}


 \levelc{Practical solution}
  A possible solution for calculating the LOS with refraction would be to 
  integrate numerically the geometrical term \citep{eriksson:00a} but 
  this approach is problematic for limb sounding as the geometric factor is
  singular at the tangent point (Figure \ref{fig:los:gfac}).
  \begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
    \includegraphics*[width=0.7\hsize]{Figs/fig_geomfac}
     \caption{The geometrical factor, as a function of altitude, for limb 
              sounding and three tangent altitudes. Taken from
              \citet{eriksson:97a}}.
    \label{fig:los:gfac}
   \end{center} 
  \end{figure}
  Further, Equation \ref{eq:los:gterm} cannot be solved analytically 
  for the simple reason that no general analytical expression for 
  $n$ exists. A possible solution would be to assume that $n$ is a
  piecewise linear function but the solution of Equation \ref{eq:los:gterm}
  is then unfortunately a very lengthy expression (at least the one provided 
  by Mathematica!). However, for a piecewise constant $n$ it is very simple
  to derive a solution of the integral, and thus avoiding the problem
  with singularities:
  \begin{equation}
    \Delta l = \sqrt{(R_e+z_2)^2 - \left( \frac{c}{\bar{n}} \right)^2} -
                     \sqrt{(R_e+z_1)^2 - \left( \frac{c}{\bar{n}} \right)^2}
  \end{equation}
  where $z_1$ and $z_2$ are two vertical altitudes, $\Delta l$ the length
  along the LOS between these two altitudes and $\bar{n}$ a mean value of
  the refractive index between $z_1$ and $z_2$. The calculations are 
  performed along the LOS and the follwing expression is used in practice
  \begin{equation}
     z_2 = \sqrt{ \left( \Delta l + 
           \sqrt{(R_e+z_1)^2 - \left( \frac{c}{\bar{n}} \right)^2}\, \right)^2
                                  + \left( \frac{c}{\bar{n}} \right)^2 } - R_e 
   \label{eq:los:refr:deltal}
  \end{equation}
  The angular distance between the points corresponding to $z_1$ and $z_2$
  is
  \begin{equation}
   \Delta \psi = \cos^{-1}\left( \frac{(R_e+z_1)^2 + (R_e+z_2)^2 - l^2}
                                                 {2(R_e+z_1)(R_e+z_2)} \right) 
   \label{eq:los:refr:deltapsi}
  \end{equation}
  The practical calculations are performed as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The lowest point of the LOS is determined and the ``zenith
          angle'' at this point. 
    \item The ray tracing step length is set to the LOS step length divided
          by the factor given by the user (\verb|refr_lfac|).
    \item The ray tracing is performed from the lowest altitude of the LOS
          until the upper limit of the atmosphere is reached.
  \end{enumerate}

  \noindent
  Each ray tracing step is performed as
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The refractive index $(\bar{n})$ is set to the value at $z_1$.
    \item The altitude of the other end of the ray tracing step is calculated
          by Equation \ref{eq:los:refr:deltal}.
    \item The refractive index at $z_2$ is determined by an interpolation
          and $(\bar{n})$ is set to the mean value of the refractive index at
          $z_1$ and $z_2$.
    \item Step 2 and 3 are repeated two times.
    \item The change in the angle $\psi$ is calculated by Equation
          \ref{eq:los:refr:deltapsi}.
  \end{enumerate}
  The number of iterations of step 2 and 3 is hard coded. A practical
  test showed a clear improvement when going from 1 to 2 iterations, a
  small improvement when going from 2 to 3 iterations and no practical
  improvement when going from 3 to 4 iterations. Accordingly, 3
  iterations are needed to reach convergence, but as the estimated
  accuracy for 2 iterations was judged to be sufficient 2 iterations
  was selected as a compremise between speed and accuracy. However,
  if the best accuracy possible is wanted, the number of iterations
  can easily be changed in the code.

  This calculation scheme has the advantage of always starting from the 
  lowest point of the LOS which should be beneficial for the calculation
  accuracy. How the tangent altitude is determined for limb sounding is 
  described below. 
  

 \levelc{Limb sounding}
    
   \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics*[width=0.8\hsize]{Figs/fig_bendingangle}
      \caption{Bending angle as a function of tangent altitude. The bending
        angle is the angle between the line from the tangent point and
        the sensor and the LOS tangent at the tangent point (see also
        \citet[][Figure 1]{kursinski:97}). Calculated for the FASCODE
        mid-latitude summer atmosphere. The figure can be compared to
        \citet[][Figure 3]{kursinski:97} and the agreeemnt is as good as
        expected.}
      \label{fig:los:bendingangle} 
    \end{center} 
  \end{figure}

  The most important factor for limb sounding is to get a correct
  tangent altitude. Fortunately, there is a way to determine the
  tangent altitude directly for 1D cases, without following the LOS
  from the top of the atmosphere.

  The tangent altitude is given by the relationship
  \begin{equation}
    (R_e+z_t)n(z_t) = (R_e+z_p)\sin(\view) = c
   \label{eq:los:ztan_ref}
  \end{equation}
  as $\sin(\theta)=1$ at tangent points, the refractive index in space
  is 1 and $sin(180^{\circ}-\view)=sin(\view)$. The tangent altitude
  is practically determined by finding the highest altitude where
  $(R_e+z)n(z)$ exceeds the value of $c$, followed by an interpolation
  of the product $(R_e+z)n(z)$ between the found altitude and the
  altitude above to find the altitude fulfilling Equation
  \ref{eq:los:ztan_ref}.
 
  For cases with ground reflections, a similar relationship,
  \begin{equation}
    (R_e+z_g)n(z_g)sin(\theta_g) = (R_e+z_p)\sin(\view) = c,
  \end{equation}
  gives the angle between the LOS and the ground normal.

  The angular distance between the tangent point and the sensor $(\psi_0)$
  is calculated as
  \begin{equation}
    \psi_0 = \theta_{z_{max}} + \view  - 180^\circ + \psi_{z_{max}}
  \end{equation}
  where $\theta_{z_{max}}$ and $\psi_{z_{max}}$ are the angles for the
  highest point of the LOS ($\theta$ defined in Figure \ref{fig:los:snell}).
  
  Figure \ref{fig:los:bendingangle} gives a good confirmation of the
  implemented refraction ray tracing scheme.

  
  
 \levelb{Ground intersections}
  \label{sec:los:ground}
  
  Ground reflections are indicated by a special flag. This flag is
  zero when there is no ground intersection or gives the index of the
  LOS point corresponding to the ground, $i_g$ (for 1-based indexing).
  For 1D calculations, $i_g$ is either 0 or 1, as index 1 is here
  defined to always be the lowest altitude of the LOS. However, to
  pave the way for 2D calculations, cases where the ground is placed
  at other positions than index 1 are handled.
  
  For 1D cases, where only half of the total LOS is stored and the
  ground can only have index 1 ($i_g=1$), the effect of a ground
  reflection (Eq. \ref{eq:rte:ground}) is put in when reversing the
  loop order. Accordingly, the calculation order is: ... step2, step
  1, ground, step 1, step 2, ... Ground reflections for 1D cases are
  treated internally in ARTS by the limb sounding functions.

\levelb{Inclusion of hydrostatic equilibrium}
 \label{sec:los:hse}

 The pressure in the atmosphere changes as
 \begin{equation}
   \Delta P = -\rho g \Delta z
 \end{equation}
 where $\Delta P$ is the change in pressure for an altitude change of
 $\Delta z$, $\rho$ is the air density and $g$ the gravitational 
 acceleration. If this expression is combined by the ideal gas law, the
 hypsometric equation is obtained:
 \begin{equation}
   z_2 - z_1 = \frac{R_d\bar{T}_v}{g}ln\Big( \frac{P_1}{P_2} \Big)
 \end{equation}
 where the indeces 1 and 2 indicate two close altitudes, $R_d$ is the
 gas constant for dry air (287.053 JK$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$) and $\bar{T}_v$
 the average virtual temperature between the altitudes $z_1$ and
 $z_2$.  The virtual temperature is introduced to include effects of
 the variable amount of water vapor. If no liquid water is present, the
 virtual temperature can be calculated as
 \begin{equation}
   T_v = T \Big( 1+0.379\frac{x_{H2O}}{1-x_{H2O}}  \Big)
 \end{equation}
 where $x_{H2O}$ is the volume mixing ratio of water vapor. 
 
 The practical calculations take into account that the gravitational
 acceleration and the average molecular weight changes with altitude.
 As the exalt altitudes not are known when starting the calculations,
 and thus there exists some uncertainty for the gravitational
 acceleration and the average molecular weight, the calculations can
 be iterated to improve the accuracy. Type \verb|arts -d hseCalc| for
 some more information.




\levelb{Control file examples}
 \label{sec:los:cfe}
 
 The practical calculations are performed by a set of functions
 \verb|refrCalc|, \verb|losCalc|, \verb|sourceCalc|, \verb|transCalc|
 and \verb|yCalc|. All these functions have no global input/output or
 keyword arguments, and the main task is to define the input for the
 functions. The sequence {\footnotesize \begin{verbatim}
refrCalc{}
losCalc{}
sourceCalc{}
transCalc{}
yCalc{} 
\end{verbatim} 
} 
\noindent 
must always be used as, for example, the variable \verb|refr_index|
must be set when calling \verb|losCalc| and \verb|source|
must be set when calculating spectra by \verb|yCalc|. If refraction
is not considered, \verb|refrCalc| sets \verb|refr_index| to be empty
and \verb|sourceCalc| does the same with \verb|source| for transmission
calculations (\verb|emission| = 0).


 \levelc{Ground-based observation}

 The following control file excerpt shows a typical example for
 simulating a ground-based observation:

 {\footnotesize
 \begin{verbatim}
# Set the radius of the geoid to a standard value
r_geoidStd{
}

# Set the platform altitude to 50 m
NumericSet( z_plat ) { 
   value = 50 
}

# Measurement in the zenith direction
VectorSet( za_pencil ) {
   length = 1
   value = 0
} 

# A step length for LOS of 500 m
NumericSet( l_step ) { 
   500 
}

# Here we don't need to care about the ground and refraction
groundOff{
}
refrOff{
}

# Cosmic radiation
y_spaceStd{ "cbgr" }

# An emission measurement
emissionOn {}

# Do the actual calculations 
refrCalc{
}
losCalc{
}
sourceCalc{
}
transCalc{
}
yCalc{
}

# Convert to Rayleigh-Jean temperature
yTRJ{}

# Save the spectra
VectorWriteBinary( y ) { 
   ""
}

 \end{verbatim}
 }



 \levelc{Limb sounding}

 The following control file excerpt shows a typical example for
 limb sounding:

 {\footnotesize
 \begin{verbatim}
# Set the geoid radius for observation in the S-N direction
# at latitude 45 degrees 
r_geoidWGS84{
   latitude     = 45
   obsdirection = 0
}

# Set the platform altitude to 620 km
NumericSet( z_plat ) { 
   value = 620e3 
}

# Five zenith angles between 113.5 and 114.0
VectorNLinSpace (za_pencil) {
   start = 113.5
   stop  = 114.0
   n     = 5 
}

# A step length for LOS of 10 km
NumericSet( l_step ) { 
   10e3
}

# A blackbody ground at 200 m
groundSet{
   z = 200
   e = 1
}

# Turn on refraction, select parameterization for refractive
# index and set ray tracing step length to 2.5 km
refrSet{
  on    = 1
  model = "Boudouris"
  lfac  = 4
}

# An emission measurement
emissionOn {}

# Cosmic radiation
y_spaceStd{ "cbgr" }

# Do the actual calculations 
refrCalc{
}
losCalc{
}
sourceCalc{
}
transCalc{
}
yCalc{
}

# Convert to Rayleigh-Jean temperature
yTRJ{}

# Save the spectra
VectorWriteBinary( y ) { 
   ""
}
 \end{verbatim}
 }



 \levelc{Limb transmission calculations}

 Simulation of transmission measurements is performed in the same way
 as emission observations. Compared to the example above, beside that
 converion to brightness temperatures shall not be done, the only
 changes are:
 {\footnotesize
 \begin{verbatim}
...
# Turn off emission
emissionOff {}

# We don't need y_space here, set to be empty
VectorSet( y_space ) {
   length = 0
   value = 0
}
...
 \end{verbatim}
 }
\noindent
