  \brief  Declarations having to do with the four output streams.

  ARTS uses four output streams: \a out0 to \a out3, where \a out0 has
  the highest priority, \a out3 the lowest. These are global
  variables. They are intended to be
  used as follows:

  \arg \a  out0: Error messages
  \arg \a  out1: Output of the `engine'
  \arg \a  out2: Important workspace method output
  \arg \a  out3: Unimportant workspace method output

  The classes associated with the four output stream variables have
  the same name, but start with a capital letter: Out0, Out1, Out2,
  and Out3.

/**
   The verbosity level for screen and file output. There are four
   different output streams: out0, out1, out2, and out3. They have different
   priority, out0 the highest, out3 the lowest.

   The verbosity level is stored in the workspace variable messages of
   this type and can be set separately for file and screen output. In
   both cases the level can range from 0 to 3, where 0 = no output
   (except error messages), 1 = only out1, 2 = out1+out2, 3 = all
   output.

   Introduced Out0, which prints to stderr rather than stdout.
