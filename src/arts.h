/**
  \file  arts.h

  The global header file for ARTS. This file is included directly or
  indirectly by each and every ARTS source file. It must therefor not
  contain stuff that should not always be present.

  Note that you do not have to include this file explicitly in many
  cases, since it is included directly or indirectly by most ARTS
  header files.

    This automatic documentation is still \e very experimental. We
    have just switched from doc++ to doxygen. You can use the HTML
    version to browse the source text. Just point and click, and
    eventually you will see the real implementation of functions and
    classes. 

    If you are looking for a more comprehensive text, check out the
    Arts User Guide that is also distributed along with the
    program. Section `Documentation' in Chapter `The art of developing
    ARTS' there also tells you how you should add documentation
    headers to your code if you are an ARTS developer.
