  \brief  Global variable definitions that 
	  depend on the automatically generated header file wsv.h

  This file contains all global variable definitions that DO depend on
  the automatically generated header file wsv.h. It is necessary to
  have these in a separate file for compiler technical reasons. (With
  g++-2.95.2 it does not work to declare them constant in the same
  file where they are defined.)
  
  Maybe this file should be removed in the future. There is not much
  stuff here.
